# ï»¿Use Case: Managing Inventory Adjustments
# **Use Case Description:**
The Admin needs to adjust inventory levels to reflect the correct stock count based on various reasons such as procurement, correction, or damage. The system provides an interface where adjustments can be created and updated with item details, reasons, and location information.

When the Admin notices discrepancies in inventory levels or needs to make corrections for any reason, such as damage, correction, or procurement.
# **Actor:**
